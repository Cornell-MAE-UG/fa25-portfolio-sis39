## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/Profile-Pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Suri Skomra, and I am a sophomore studying mechanical engineering. I am from San Francisco but spent three years in Princeton, NJ for high school. Some of my interests include swimming, architecture, robotics and backpacking. Ai Cornell I have done research in the Organic Robotics lab where I worked with a team to create a robot that analyzes root health, I am on the triatholon club team and I am also apart of PSO (Cornell's Persian Student Organization). I hope to pursue more research in robotics and aerospace engineering.
