# About Me

![Profile Picture]({{ '/assets/images/Profile-Pic.jpg' | relative_url }})
 
My name is Suri Skomra, and I am a sophomore at Cornell University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Architecture. Originally from San Francisco, I spent three years in Princeton, New Jersey, where I completed high school before beginning my studies at Cornell.

I am currently an intern at Northstar Earth and Space, where I contribute to the development of AI-driven remote sensing models using multimodal satellite data. I work with geospatial foundation models such as TerraMind and assist in fine-tuning models using TerraTorch and PyTorch Lightning to support applications including flood and burn scar detection. This role has strengthened my interest in the intersection of aerospace systems, data-driven modeling, and large-scale environmental monitoring.

Previously, as a research assistant in Cornell’s Organic Robotics Laboratory, I collaborated on the development of an Arduino-based underground robot designed to non-invasively monitor root health, contributing to imaging optimization, hardware testing, and CAD-based system design 

Beyond academics and research, I am a member of the Cornell Triathlon Club Team and the Persian Students Organization. I enjoy swimming, architecture, robotics, and backpacking. Moving forward, I hope to further pursue research in robotics and aerospace engineering, focusing on innovative systems that combine intelligent design with real-world impact.
