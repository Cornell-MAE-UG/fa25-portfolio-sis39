In this project, I was asked to design a two-dimensional lifting mechanism within a 150 cm by 50 cm workspace. The design was required to use a rigid bar of fixed length, three pin supports (two mounted on the ground), and a single linear actuator selected from the Tolomatic IMA catalog. The goal was to create a rigid frame or mechanism capable of lifting the maximum possible load to the greatest possible height, assuming all supports, bars, and actuators are rigid.


To complete this project, I applied principles of statics and mechanics of solids to analyze possible linkage configurations and actuator placements. I evaluated multiple design options, including single-bar and angled-bar mechanisms, to determine which geometry provided the best balance between lift height and mechanical advantage. The actuator was chosen based on its maximum rated force, ensuring that the design operated within realistic mechanical limits.


The final configuration allows for efficient vertical motion within the 50 cm height constraint while maintaining structural stability and load-bearing capacity. A detailed hand-drawn sketch of the mechanism accompanies this report as part of the design documentation.
